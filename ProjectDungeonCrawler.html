                <p>
                    Dungeon and Death is a game jam game that a couple of friends and I made. The theme of the jam was
                    'Sacrifices must be made'. The goal of the game is to survive the dungeon, reach the end of each
                    stage, and descend to the next level. To align with the jam's theme, we came up with the idea that
                    your three starting companions all have different needs, such as food, and when their resources run
                    out, they die. However, there isn't enough food for all your companions, so you must make decisions
                    and let go of some as you progress.

                    For this project, I didn't do much programming because I wanted to focus more on 3D modeling, which
                    was something I wanted to learn, especially texturing the models. I used MagicaVoxel for the 3D
                    models and textures. I chose that program because it's ideal for creating quick and visually
                    appealing models, and it allows you to paint directly on the models. Additionally, I handled all the
                    2D sprites and animations. I used Pyxel Edit for the sprites because its built-in animation tools
                    are ideal for games.
