                <p>
                    Mutiny in the Moonlight, AKA Bouncy Boat, is an adventure game in the style of Oregon Trail in which
                    you have to make it to the end of a harrowing journey as a pirate sailing the seven seas. The goal
                    of this game is to make it to the end of the journey while juggling resources such as food. As you
                    travel, you arrive at several islands along the way where you can buy food with money or scavenge
                    the island to search for resources.

                    What makes this so special for me is because: this is a game that combines 2D and 3D in an engine
                    that did not really support 3D modes back then. (Gamemaker 8.1). Because of that, we had to use
                    creative ways to bypass the limits of the engine. For instance, the editor for the level is fully in
                    2D, so we could only place walls and objects that would permanently face the player because they
                    were 2D sprites.

                    My tasks during this project were a mix of 2D sprite work (boat, islands, and textures), animations
                    for the boat, and general gameplay programming.
