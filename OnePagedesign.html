                <p>
                    This is a menu design for a fictional restaurant in the style of the Dutch designer Jurriaan
                    Schrofer. For this project, I had to research various elements, such as how Jurriaan created his
                    designs and apply them in a unique yet still recognizable manner, incorporating his signature design
                    elements.
                </p>
                <p class="Bold">The challenge:</p>
                <p>
                    The design challenge was to investigate what made Jurriaan's work unique and then create a design in
                    his style while incorporating the given content provided by the client.
                </p>
                <p class="Bold">My role and duration:</p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I was the sole designer, and I created everything myself. It took me approximately
                    one month to complete. excluding the research.
                </p>
                <p class="Bold">The Process:</p>
                <p>
                    For this project, my first step was to research Jurriaan's work. I discovered that he extensively
                    used typography in a grid and created entire images solely from letters. Keeping this in mind, I
                    began investigating how he created his letters. He crafted his letters within grids of varying
                    sizes, forming letters and symbols entirely within that grid.
                    With all this research in mind, I started designing the individual elements. For each page, I took
                    inspiration from one of his works to inform my design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The result is a complete poster, designed in the style of Schrofer, that provides all the necessary
                    information to understand everything about the restaurant in a beautiful and engaging manner.
                </p>
                <p>

                    second page
