                </h2>
                <p>
                    Where is Wally is a project that I made for an introductory programming class. In this class, we
                    were tasked with creating a JavaScript script that manipulates the DOM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my project, I created a 'simple' search puzzle where the objective is to find all of Wally's
                    friends in an illustration. You can search the image by dragging your mouse over it, and a
                    'magnifying glass' will appear with a zoomed-in image. Once you find a target, you can click on it
                    to check it off the list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project went through several iterations and completely different versions before reaching its
                    current state. The main challenge and subject of many changes was the main canvas on which I drew
                    the image. Initially, I allowed users to drag the image around, but as I progressed, it became
                    increasingly difficult to implement the clicking functionality for the targets. Due to time
                    constraints, I had to modify the approach instead of finding a way to make it work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ultimately, the system I have now consists of two canvases. The first canvas is rendered on the main
                    page and displays the full image with invisible buttons placed at specific canvas coordinates. The
                    second canvas is rendered inside the magnifying glass. The magnifying glass acts as a window that
                    shows an image rendered behind everything else, allowing the user to zoom in and explore.
                </p>

                    If you'd like to try it for yourself, you can access it here. Please note that it might not work
                    well on smaller or larger screens as it was designed for a 1080p screen with no image scaling.
