                    Untitled Clicker Game is a project I created for another game jam, with an even shorter development
                    time than most jams. I managed to make this game in less than 10 hours for a school game jam held at
                    the end of each school year.

                    In this game, you can click on one of the three available resources: Factory, Farm, and Water. As
                    you collect more resources, you can open the animated radial menus at the bottom. These menus,
                    completely animated through code, allow you to purchase upgrades and automatic clickers. The
                    objective is to gather as many resources as possible.

                    For this project, I challenged myself to maximize the juiciness of the game, aiming for smoothness
                    without interrupting the gameplay. The most challenging aspect was creating all the animations with
                    code, including the squishiness effect when clicking on resources and the radial menus. I built
                    everything from scratch using C#, and I also created all the sprites and buttons myself.
