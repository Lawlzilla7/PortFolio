                <p>
                    Mutiny in the Moonlight, also known as Bouncy Boat, is an adventure game inspired by Oregon Trail,
                    where you embark on a perilous journey as a pirate sailing the seven seas. The objective of the game
                    is to reach the end of the journey while managing resources like food. Along the way, you encounter
                    various islands where you can either purchase food with money or scavenge the island for resources.

                    What makes this game particularly special to me is the fact that it combines 2D and 3D elements in
                    an engine that didn't have built-in support for 3D modes at the time (Gamemaker 8.1). Due to this
                    limitation, we had to employ creative solutions to work around the engine's constraints. For
                    example, the level editor was entirely in 2D, which meant we could only position walls and objects
                    that would always face the player since they were represented as 2D sprites

                <p>
                    My tasks during this project were a mix of 2D sprite work (boat, islands, and textures), animations
                    for the boat, and general gameplay programming
