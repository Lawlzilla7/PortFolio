                <!-- <h2 class="AboutH2">VirtualMaxx 2.0</h2> -->
                <p>
                    VirtualMaxx 2.0 is a game that I, along with a few colleagues, developed during my year-long
                    internship
                    at LaserMaxx Lasergames B.V. We created both a VR and desktop game where up to 16 players enter a
                    virtual arena with the objective of locating and eliminating other players while accumulating as
                    many points as possible. They can achieve this by teleporting using the well-known Lasermaxx laser
                    tag gun equipped with a Vive Tracker from platform to platform and shooting by pulling the trigger.
                    The game also features multiple power-ups that players can collect, such as a cover wall for taking
                    cover, Rapidfire for fully automatic shooting, and a healing box for healing during combat.
                </p>
                <p class="Bold">Our goals:</p>
                <p>
                    Our goal for this project was to bring the laser tag experience into a digital world with additional
                    elements that are only possible digitally, such as a large play area with power-ups. That's why we
                    also modified a weapon to match the laser tag experience offered by LaserMaxx.

                <p>
                    <span class="Bold"> During this project, my responsibilities included:</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="Bold"> Game Design:</span>
                    This involved defining the gameplay loop and ensuring that all individual elements of
                    the game come together cohesively.
                    <span class="Bold">Shader Programming:</span>
                    I worked on programming shaders for various aspects of the game, including the
                    skyboxes, advertising boards, and shooting effects.
                    <span class="Bold">Gameplay:</span>
                    I programmed various gameplay elements, such as the platforms and in-game events, to make
                    the game engaging and functional.
                    <span class="Bold">Level Design:</span>
                    I designed multiple levels and the rooms where players start, ensuring that they
                    provide interesting and challenging environments for gameplay.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="Bold"> What made this project so challenging</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    the fact that it combined multiple games in one. Players
                    engage in VR in a separate room, administrators have a different perspective and can intervene
                    through a separate computer with a regular screen, and spectators can watch the entire playing field
                    through a separate TV feed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because there are multiple screens and user roles, we had to design the game in a way that not only
                    works on all computers but also provides completely different experiences for the different types of
                    users they are.
                </p>
                <p> This game has gone through multiple versions, which is why it's referred to as version 2.0. Version
                    1 had a completely different world that was much larger and more primitive, lacking an improved
                    interface, effects, lighting system, atmospheric system in the form of a skybox, and advertisements
                    on the billboards. In short, there were many differences that led us to call it 2.0 because it no
                    longer resembles the first version.
